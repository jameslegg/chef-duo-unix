Description
===========
Installs Duo Unix 2-factor authentication. Currently tested (barely) on Debian 7.0 x32, Ubuntu 12.04 x32 Server, Ubuntu 12.10 x32 Server

Where available this cookbook installs from Duo Security's pre built apt repository on Ubuntu/Debian. Otherwise it will build from source.

Using the OpenSSH cookbook to manage ssh configuration means that only the sshd attributes defined in this cookbook or elsewhere will will end up in sshd_config. This can cause unexpected behaviour.

This cookbook uses Test Kitchen to run ServerSpec tests.
